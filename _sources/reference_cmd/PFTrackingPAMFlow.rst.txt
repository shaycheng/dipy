PFTrackingPAMFlow
========================

Workflow for Particle Filtering Tracking.

This workflow use a saved peaks and metrics (PAM) file as input.

Parameters
----------
pam_files : string
   Path to the peaks and metrics files. This path may contain
    wildcards to use multiple masks at once.
wm_files : string
    Path of White matter for stopping criteria for tracking.
gm_files : string
    Path of grey matter for stopping criteria for tracking.
csf_files : string
    Path of cerebrospinal fluid for stopping criteria for tracking.
seeding_files : string
    A binary image showing where we need to seed for tracking.
step_size : float, optional
    Step size used for tracking.
back_tracking_dist : float, optional
    Distance in mm to back track before starting the particle filtering
    tractography. The total particle filtering tractography distance is
    equal to back_tracking_dist + front_tracking_dist.
    By default this is set to 2 mm.
front_tracking_dist : float, optional
    Distance in mm to run the particle filtering tractography after the
    the back track distance. The total particle filtering tractography
    distance is equal to back_tracking_dist + front_tracking_dist. By
    default this is set to 1 mm.
max_trial : int, optional
    Maximum number of trial for the particle filtering tractography
    (Prevents infinite loops, default=20).
particle_count : int, optional
    Number of particles to use in the particle filter. (default 15)
seed_density : int, optional
    Number of seeds per dimension inside voxel (default 1).
     For example, seed_density of 2 means 8 regularly distributed
     points in the voxel. And seed density of 1 means 1 point at the
     center of the voxel.
pmf_threshold : float, optional
    Threshold for ODF functions. (default 0.1)
max_angle : float, optional
    Maximum angle between tract segments. This angle can be more
    generous (larger) than values typically used with probabilistic
    direction getters. The angle range is (0, 90)
out_dir : string, optional
   Output directory (default input file directory)
out_tractogram : string, optional
   Name of the tractogram file to be saved (default 'tractogram.trk')
